<p>This model studies the usual place of residence of Sydney's population by age, with a developed comparison between four age groups. Having a population of over five million as well as being the twelveth most expensive city in the world, Sydney's age distribution is constantly changing and evolving. Sydney has had an 8% increase of general population from 2011 to 2016, as a result, major housing developments have taken place and future developments will follow. This has resulted in hubs of popular areas for the different age groups 0 to 19, 20 to 39, 40 to 59 and 60+, which will be explored by the data maps.<br>
