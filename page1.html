<h1>Introdution</h1>

<p>The data set consists of the age of individuals living in Australia separated by sex. It can be seen from the data that the median age in NSW is 37.6 years old, and the male to female ratio is 98.5. This data is collected to provide information to the public and private sectors to improve Sydney's housing and social implications. From this data, it can be seen to correlate to housing cost, where young adults are unable to afford housing in suburbs and would rent apartments in the city to be closer to work. These are concentrated around Parramatta, Burwood, Homebush, Rhodes, Zetland and the CBD, where majority of the suburb are apartment developments. Young families looking for housing with more space have had to move further west in areas such as The Ponds and Badgery Creek due to the cheaper housing and new urban development. Older people tend to live along the waterfront for a relaxed lifestyle or move towards the rural areas of NSW. This implicates that CBDs are planned to be high density due to work opportunities and the suburbs are lower density to allow space for families.<br>
