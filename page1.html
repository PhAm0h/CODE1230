<h1>What Does The Data Tell Me?</h1>

<p>The data set consists of the place of usual residence  of individuals living in Australia separated by into age groups.  This data is collected to provide information to the public and private sectors to improve Sydney's housing and social implications. From this data, it can be seen to correlate to housing cost, where young adults are unable to afford housing in suburbs and would rent apartments in the city to be closer to work. Young families looking for housing with more space have had to move further west in areas due to the cheaper housing and new urban development. This implicates that CBDs are planned to be high density due to work opportunities and the suburbs are lower density to allow space for families.<br>
